\section{Conclusion}
We propose a reinforcement learning based deep reasoning model for reading comprehension. Compared to the conventional end-to-end models for machine comprehension, our model can learn a human like multi-step reasoning process guided by the discourse information and question topic.
 % Our model surpasses all other comparison methods on different reading comprehension datasets. Furthermore, 
 We show that learned logic reasoning is transferable between datasets/tasks. that is the model can imitate at least a simple human reasoning. 
 % For future work we are trying to use each word in a context as a segmentation point, at a cost of larger action and state space, with a more flexible decision making process.
