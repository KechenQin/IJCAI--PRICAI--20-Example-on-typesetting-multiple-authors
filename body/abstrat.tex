In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based deep reasoning model (DRM) for reading comprehension tasks. By developing its reasoning ability, the model can search for the correct answer within the set of pre-defined segments separated by discourse markers. Unlike the previous machine comprehension or question answering methods, our model has the ability to generate an interpretable reasoning process, which makes for good answer explanations on datasets with dense discourse information. Furthermore, we show that the learned reasoning logic obtained from one dataset is also applicable to another domain, thus logic is transferable. 
% , hence represents a general logic reasoning process.
